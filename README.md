# Matrix Multiplication and Activation Function Computation
I have developed a basic AI accelerator that performs matrix multiplication and computes activation functions. This is only for 2x2 matrices.

The implementation utilizes pre-defined Verilog modules for simplicity and modularity. The matrix_multiplication.v file contains the design logic for performing matrix multiplication and applying the activation function. The matrix_multiplication_tb.v file serves as the testbench to verify the functionality and correctness of the design.
